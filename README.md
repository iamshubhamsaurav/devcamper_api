This Devcamper API is based on Brad Traversy's course. I am using the knowledge to build a bootcamp directory backend with more functionality

This API can now be used in production. I have tested the application and this app will be maintained in the future. If you catch a bug or you want a new feature, let me know. I, myself will be adding new features to the API as I grow as a backend developer.
